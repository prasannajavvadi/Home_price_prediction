Project Title: Housing Price Prediction

Overview:
This project aims to analyze housing data and build a predictive model to estimate the prices of houses based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, etc. The dataset used for this project contains information about real estate properties including their attributes like square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location coordinates, etc.

Objectives:
1. Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and distributions.
2. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable (house prices).
4. Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing features to improve model performance.
5. Model Building: Build machine learning models to predict house prices. Evaluate and compare the performance of different models.
6. Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model to make predictions on new data.

Tools and Technologies:
- Python: Programming language used for data analysis, visualization, and model building.
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for running Python code and analyzing data.
- Libraries: Various Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains information about real estate properties including the following features:
- id: Unique identifier for each property
- date: Date when the property was sold
- price: Sale price of the property
- bedrooms: Number of bedrooms in the property
- bathrooms: Number of bathrooms in the property
- sqft_living: Total square footage of the living area
- sqft_lot: Total square footage of the lot
- floors: Number of floors in the property
- waterfront: Whether the property has a waterfront view (binary: 0 or 1)
- view: Number of views the property has received
- condition: Overall condition of the property
- grade: Overall grade given to the property based on King County grading system
- sqft_above: Square footage of the house apart from the basement
- sqft_basement: Square footage of the basement
- yr_built: Year the property was built
- yr_renovated: Year the property was last renovated
- zipcode: Zip code of the property
- lat: Latitude coordinate of the property
- long: Longitude coordinate of the property
- sqft_living15: Square footage of the living area for the nearest 15 neighbors
- sqft_lot15: Square footage of the lot for the nearest 15 neighbors

Execution:
1. Data Preparation: Upload the dataset to Google Colab and preprocess the data.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Explore the dataset to gain insights and visualize the relationships between different features and the target variable.
3. Model Building: Build and train machine learning models such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, etc., to predict house prices.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared, etc.
5. Deployment: Deploy the trained model to make predictions on new data or integrate it into a web application for end-users.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the process of analyzing real estate data and building a predictive model to estimate house prices. By leveraging machine learning techniques, valuable insights can be gained to assist in decision-making processes related to buying, selling, or investing in real estate properties.


# README: Executing Code 

This guide explains how to execute code in Jupyter or Google Colab after uploading a CSV file.

## Step 1: Uploading the CSV File to Google Colab/Jupyter

1. Open Google Colab/Jupyter in your web browser.
2. Click on "File" in the top left corner.
3. Select "Upload" and navigate to the location of your CSV file on your computer.
4. Select the CSV file and click on "Open" to upload it to Google Colab.

## Step 2: Writing and Executing Code in Google Colab

1. Once the CSV file is uploaded, you can start writing your Python code in a new code cell.
2. To create a new code cell, click on the "+" button in the toolbar above or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + M B.
3. Write your Python code in the code cell. You can use libraries like pandas to read the uploaded CSV file and perform data analysis.
4. After writing your code, you can execute it by clicking on the "Play" button in the code cell or by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Enter.
5. Google Colab/Jupyter will execute the code and display the output directly below the code cell.
